### Live Site: https://classictvmusic.netlify.app/

### Project Description: Personal
### Programs Used: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
### Date Created: 2020

## Description: 
This is a front-end playlist app I created of soundtracks and intros from some of my favorite television shows of the 1980s using HTML and CSS for the layout of the app and Javascript for the functionality of the app. The playlist comes with volume control functionality with the volume slider in place along with the ability for the user to navigate through the playlist using the previous and next buttons in place or clicking on the soundtrack or intro of their choice in the playlist.
